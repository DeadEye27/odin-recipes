    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Sugar:</strong> You'll need white sugar for the cake and confectioners' sugar for the frosting.</li>
        <li><strong>Oil:</strong> A neutral oil, such as vegetable oil, adds moisture without imparting flavor.</li>
        <li><strong>Eggs:</strong> Four whole eggs lend moisture and help bind the carrot cake batter together.</li>
        <li><strong>Vanilla:</strong> Two teaspoons of vanilla extract for the cake (and one teaspoon for the frosting) enhances the flavor.</li>
        <li><strong>Flour:</strong> All-purpose flour creates structure and brings the batter together.</li>
        <li><strong>Leaveners:</strong> Baking soda and baking powder act as leaveners, which means they help the cake rise.</li>
        <li><strong>Cinnamon:</strong> Ground cinnamon adds that warm, cozy flavor you associate with carrot cake.</li>
        <li><strong>Salt:</strong> Salt enhances the flavors of the other ingredients, but it won't make the cake taste salty.</li>
        <li><strong>Carrots:</strong> Of course, you'll need grated carrots!</li>
        <li><strong>Pecans:</strong> Chopped pecans give the cake and frosting a pleasant crunch.</li>
        <li><strong>Butter </strong> and <strong>Cream Cheese:</strong> Butter and cream cheese are the key ingredients in the light and fluffy cream cheese frosting.</li>
    </ul>
